Gala Groceries saw the results of the machine learning model as promising and believe that with more data and time, it can add real value to the business.

To build the foundation for this machine learning use case, they want to implement a first version of the algorithm into production.
In the current state, as a Python notebook, this is not suitable to productionize a machine learning model. 

Therefore, as the Data Scientist that created this algorithm, it is your job to prepare a Python module that contains code to train a model and output the performance metrics when the file is run.
